This project will demonstrate some method for cleaning data. After the data is cleaned, it will be analyzed through visualization to find interesting insight. 

## About The Project
Frequently when we work with data, we encounter unstructured and/or messy data. Messy data can take a variety of forms. This could mean any of the following:

- The columns are mislabeled or do not have variable names.
- The dataset contains nonsensical data.
- Variables are stored in both the columns and rows.

While the data may be messy, it is still extremely informative. We need to clean, transform, and sometimes manipulate the data structure to gain any insights. This process is often called **data wrangling**.

Having clean data will improves data quality. Ultimately, this will allow us to make better data-driven decision-making for business.

The aim of this project is to demonstrate some method for cleaning data. After the data is cleaned, it will be analyzed through visualization to find interesting insight.

## Data Wrangling Method
In this project, we will cover some technique for data wrangling, such as:

- Remove unused column
- Create new columns based on existing column
- Using regex to manipulate string data
- Convert data type to another type
- Check and handle missing values
- Check and drop duplicated data

In addition, we also analyze the data using visualization to find insight. Data cleaning is one of the most important part of data analytic process, and a data analyst should always spend some time to clean and validate their data.
